= Getting Started with Broadleaf Microservices

The
https://www.broadleafcommerce.com/microservices[Broadleaf Microservices Framework]
is a collection of enterprise components and libraries to accelerate your application
development. The framework includes 30+ microservices containing extensible commerce service components built on Java and Spring as well as a centralized metadata-driven admin built in React.

This project is intended to give you a hands on look at core concepts and extension patterns as well
as providing an overview of the key commerce and PIM features provided
with the framework.

---

---

== Project Goals
The guides and tutorials in this project will walk you through:

- getting the core commerce framework services running locally
- running a reference implementation of Broadleaf's unified microservices admin which can manage 
data across the various microservices
- running a reference implementation of a consumer-facing storefront application
- concepts around extending and customizing the framework

== What Do I Need?
In order to get this reference project running locally, you will want to obtain and install 
the following:

=== Credentials
Access to Broadleaf's Docker Registry and Maven Nexus is needed in order to pull down the 
appropriate resources.

Once you have obtained these credentials, you will need to configure them for the dependencies
below.

[NOTE]
====
Contact `info@broadleafcommerce.com` for information on how to receive these credentials
====

=== Java
You will need Java 8 or 11 installed on your machine.

* https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/11/[Open JDK]
* https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html[Oracle JDK]

=== Docker
You will need to have https://docs.docker.com/install/[Docker Engine & Docker Compose] installed
locally

[TIP]
====
Docker Desktop for both Mac and Windows already includes compose along with other
docker apps.
====

Once you have docker installed, you will want to authenticate with Broadleaf's docker registry.

Type the following into your CLI:

[source,shell script]
----
docker login repository.broadleafcommerce.com:5001
----

When prompted, type in the username and password you received above.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You'll also want to configure Docker settings to use appropriate resources.
A good rule of thumb is to allow Docker to consume around 3/4 of your system resources
as necessary.

At a minimum, you will want to allocate at least 2 CPUs and 4-6 GB Memory

Ideally for a developer machine, you will want to allocate something like:
6 CPUs, 8 GB Memory, 4 GB Swap.
====

=== Maven
You'll need to have Maven installed locally as well. 
https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven 3.5 or later] is recommended.

Once you have maven installed, another step you need to do before you can
build the project is to configure the authentication. Maven requires it to be specified in a
file called `settings.xml` that has to be in the `.m2` subdirectory in a userâ€™s home directory.

1. Create a folder called `.m2` in your home directory
2. Create a file called `settings.xml` in the `.m2` folder
3. Copy the following contents to your `~/.m2/settings.xml` making sure to
replace the credentials with the ones you received above:

[source,xml]
----
<settings xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.1.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.1.0.xsd"
    xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.1.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>broadleaf-microservices</id>
      <username>username_here</username>
      <password>password_here</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
----

[TIP]
====
More info about authenticating with private repositories can be found
https://maven.apache.org/settings.html#Servers[here] and
https://maven.apache.org/ref/3.6.3/maven-settings/settings.html[here]
====

== Building & Running the Project

=== Building

Now that all of the pre-requisites are installed, let's build and run the project!

1. First, we'll need to download or clone this project so that we can run
everything locally on your own machine. You can utilize the `Clone or Download` button at
the top right of this page.
+
2. Once you have the project downloaded, let's go ahead and build it using Maven. You're going to
navigate to the root folder (i.e. the folder that contains the main `pom.xml` file) of where you
downloaded/un-zipped or cloned the project. In the root of this project run the following to build:
+
[source,shell script]
----
mvn clean install
----
+
[NOTE]
====
It may take some time during the initial installation as the process needs to download all required
dependencies. All subsequent builds should go much faster.
====
+
[TIP]
====
You can enable running the example tests in this project by running `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false`
====
+
3. Before you start up all the APIs, you'll need to first start up a few supporting services
that are required for this example. These services are provided via docker images and can be run
and started from the command line by navigating to the root of this project and running:
+
[source,shell script]
----
docker-compose up -d && ./check-services-status.sh
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The above command starts the creation process of all the supporting services using `docker-compose`.
We've also included a script to "tail" all the relevant containers and verify successful startup.

[source,shell script]
----
./check-services-status.sh
----

This shell script will wait (for a period of time) to verify that all supporting services have
started up before exiting and should produce something like below when everything is up and running:

[source,shell script]
----
zk - Container Started
openapi-ui - Container Started
auth - Container Started
commercegateway - Container Started
admingateway - Container Started
commerceweb - Container Started
adminweb - Container Started
localsolr - Container Started
database - Container Started
localkafka - Container Started
adminweb - Service Ready
openapi-ui - Service Ready
commerceweb - Service Ready
localsolr - Service Ready
zk - Service Ready
auth - Service Ready
commercegateway - Service Ready
admingateway - Service Ready
localkafka - Service Ready
----
====

=== Running Backend APIs

==== Starting the Spring Boot Application
Next, you will want to start up the core backend commerce APIs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You'll want to make sure that all your docker images have started up successfully
before running this command, otherwise you may get startup errors trying to connect to a service
that may not have finished completing.
====

You can start the APIs using the maven spring boot plugin using this command:
[source,shell script]
----
mvn spring-boot:run
----

[NOTE]
====
If you are running into issues running via the maven spring-boot plugin on Windows due to "large classpath/filename too long" errors. You can also start the application as an executable jar.

[source,shell script]
----
java -jar -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=8004 target/ms-tutorial-getting-started.jar
----
====

[NOTE]
====
Depending on your configured system resources, this may take some time to fully start up.

In general, the sequence of events that you will encounter include:

1. Tomcat initialization
2. SQL changelog execution
3. SOLR and Zookeeper connection initialization
4. Spring bean initialization
5. Kafka Pub/Sub messaging channel and consumer initialization
6. Tomcat started on port(s): 8447 (https) with context path ''
7. Started TutorialGettingStartedApplication
====

That's it! Once you've verified that the supporting services and backend APIs are running, you can visit
the administration console and the consumer storefronts from a browser:

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are having issues visiting the storefront links, you will either need to set up DNSMasq
in order to map URLs to `localhost` or set up `/etc/hosts` with the `heatclinic` and `aaahotsauces`
subdomains.

We recommend using Chrome since the above should be handled automatically.
You'll also want to enable insecure localhost by visiting: chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost
====

- Admin Console: https://localhost:8446
* Username: `master@test.com`
* Password: `Pass1word!`
- Storefront 1: https://heatclinic.localhost:8456
- Storefront 2: https://aaahotsauces.localhost:8456

[NOTE]
====
Remember to shutdown your docker services when finished in order to free up resources i.e. `docker-compose down`
====

===== Viewing OpenAPI Specs & Testing Endpoints

During local development or evaluation, you may find it beneficial to view API documentation
around exposed services within the project. To facilitate this, we've provided a supporting
docker image that will run in the background that includes our Open API specs for some of the
core framework services along with a Swagger UI that allows users to "Try Out" various endpoints.

Next, you can visit the Open API UI by visiting:

- https://localhost:8446/api/docs

[NOTE]
====
make sure you have the supporting docker container `openapi-ui` running
====

You should be able to see an interface that allows you to navigate and try out various
APIs provided by some core Broadleaf services.

++++
<p align="center">
    <img src="images/OpenAPI.png" alt="Open API UI" width="738">
</p>
++++

[TIP]
====
Be sure to "Try Out" a few endpoints as the specs do define example payloads that should return
valid data given the test seed data loaded for this project.

The default credentials are:

* client_id = `openapi`
* client_secret = `openapi_secret`
====

==== Starting Up With Other RDBMS Platforms `[Alternative]`
By default, the supporting services and demo application startup with support for Postgres. However,
the demo is designed to also support Oracle, MySql, and MariaDB. To switch to one of the other
platforms, you should do the following:

1. Instead of the standard docker-compose startup command, use a specialized version that includes
the compose file targeting your platform
+
[source,console]
----
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.mysql.yml up -d
----
+
2. Instead of the standard spring boot run startup command, use a specialized version that includes
the profile targeting your platform
+
[source,console]
----
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=default,mysql
----

==== Testing Endpoints Directly using cURL `[Alternative]`

Another alternative evaluation flow or local development flow may include being able to easily hit
endpoints directly either via `cURL` or utilizing a tool like https://www.postman.com/[POSTMAN].
In this case, you can disable security when starting up the backend services using the
following command (instead of the simple `mvn spring-boot:run` command outlined above)
so that you don't have to worry about getting a valid JWT authentication token every time:

[source,shell script]
----
mvn spring-boot:run -Pnosec
----

Once you have the services running, you should be able to issue a `cURL` request like:

[source,shell script]
----
curl --insecure -X GET "https://localhost:8447/products?offset=0&forward=true&pageSize=50" -H "accept: application/json" -H "X-Context-Request: {\"tenantId\":\"5DF1363059675161A85F576D\",\"catalogId\":\"3\"}"
----

== Project Structure Overview

This project is structured in a manner that is meant to easily demonstrate various
features and aspects of the framework and does not necessarily reflect how you may want to structure
your real implementation project. 

Specifically, the structure intends to demonstrate the framework's flexible composition model - you 
have the ability to selectively compose multiple services into a single deployment or deploy them 
independently.

image::images/MS_Custom_Deployment_Options.png[]

[NOTE]
====
This particular project demonstrates the ability to compose a majority of the core
backend commerce services together into a single deployable spring boot application.
====

=== Important Pieces
The following are the main components of this project and should be noted:

1. `docker-compose.yml` - this is the main entrypoint for utilizing the project. 
This defines some supporting services that are required to run the full scope of these examples.
See this FAQ: "<<faq-supporting-services>>" to get a description about each of these images
2. `pom.xml` - this defines the core commerce library dependencies that will be utilized 
for this guide (e.g. catalog, pricing, offers, etc...)
3. `src/main/resources/application-default.yml` - this file configures a few default local 
property configurations for the backend commerce services including database configuration and
initialization parameters

== Things to Try
Once you've started up both the admin and the storefront. Here are a couple things you may
want to try:


- As the "Master" admin user, try switching between different applications using the site selector
in the left hand navigation. Once you are working in a particular context (e.g. Heat Clinic), you
can start modifying and editing items which you can then deploy to the corresponding storefront.
- Modifying an existing product in the admin, saving those changes, and then promoting and deploying
that change into production.
- Creating a new offer that targets a specific SKU or Variant
- Try logging in as a different admin user to view the experience for someone with limited roles and permission:
* Username: `readonly@test.com`
* Password: `Pass1word!`


== What's Next?
Now that you have the project running and have a high level understanding of how to build
and use it, the next step would be to walk through some typical customizations.

You can follow the customization steps outlined in the following tutorial project:

- https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/MicroservicesTutorial/tree/develop/ms-tutorial-extension-complete[Customization & Extension Guide]

[TIP]
====
When you finish, you can check your results against the code in `MicroservicesTutorial/ms-tutorial-extension-complete`.

- Checkout out Broadleaf's https://developer.broadleafcommerce.com[Developer Center] for more details around the full suite of services.

== FAQ

[[faq-where-data-stored]]
=== Where is the data for these services stored?

- By default, one of the supporting services defined in this project is a Postgres DB.
For this project, each individual service is configured to point to the same Postgres instance 
with a unique schema. The default schemas that correspond to each service can be found in 
`application-default.yml` (or the corresponding RDBMS platform config)


[[faq-where-data-from]]
=== Where did all this initial data come from?

- All of the Broadleaf services come with a set of default demo data provided via a
liquibase demo changelog file. The seed data scripts are
contained within each of the individual services dependency `.jar` and are loaded via a property
configured in `application-default.yml` (or the corresponding RDBMS platform config)

=== What core commerce capabilities are available with Broadleaf Microservices?

See our
https://developer.broadleafcommerce.com/[Developer Center] for more information around Broadleaf's core capabilities.

[[faq-supporting-services]]
=== What is the purpose for all of these supporting docker services?

- the `docker-compose` file defines various services that aid in facilitating a full commerce 
experience needed for this overview project and tutorial, such as an `auth` service and
a couple API gateways. A majority of these images should be considered for example purposes only
and **not for Production use**. The following is a list of all the supporting services with a brief
description of their intent.

[[faq-how-to-create-application]]
=== How do I create a new Application in the Admin?

See the steps outlined here for
https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/MicroservicesStarter/tree/develop/docs/Application_Provisioning.adoc[Creating an Application]

[[faq-why-no-images]]
=== Why are images broken on the commerce storefront?

Images are being served on a different port, so you may need to accept the self-signed localhost
SSL cert first. Try visiting an image directly
https://localhost:8447/content/default-hero.jpg?contextRequest=%7B%22forceCatalogForFetch%22:false,%22applicationId%22:%222%22,%22tenantId%22:%225DF1363059675161A85F576D%22%7D[here]

Once you've informed your browser it is safe to proceed, try refreshing the page and the browser should proceed to load the images.

[[faq-docker-linux-host-issue]]
=== I'm running in a linux environment and getting "Unable to connect to host.docker.internal" errors?

"host.docker.internal" doesn't currently resolve properly using Docker for linux as it does
for Docker Desktop for Mac or Windows. As a workaround, you can change the references in the
`.env` file in this project to use the `docker0` interface ip instead (typically `172.17.0.1`)
which you can verify by running the following: `ip route | grep docker0 | awk '{print $9}'`

[[faq-PKIX-path-building-failed]]
=== I'm unable to build due to a PKIX SunCertPathBuilderException exception

If you're running an older versions of java (e.g. below 1.8u101) you may run into a similar error as below:

[source]
----
[ERROR] Non-resolvable import POM: Could not transfer artifact com.broadleafcommerce.microservices:broadleaf-microservices-dependencies:pom:1.0.2.5-RC2 from/to broadleaf-microservices (https://repository.broadleafcommerce.com/repository/microservices/): sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target @ line 209, column 25
----

This is because the Broadleaf Repository has an SSL cert provided by Let's Encrypt. It's easiest to upgrade your java version to one's that have Let's Encrypt as a certified authority. See here for more details: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34110426/does-java-support-lets-encrypt-certificates

[[faq-app-failed-to-start]]
=== I'm unable to start the app due to a Solr or Postgres Connection Failure

Double check you have given Docker enough resources as described in the Docker section above. The supporting services may fail to start up or may fail to connect if not given enough resources.

[[faq-windows-path-too-long]]
=== I am running on Windows, and when executing mvn spring-boot:run, I get the error "CreateProcess error=206, The filename or extension is too long."

This is a hardcoded limitation imposed by Windows on command lengths, and a known issue with Spring Boot due to how it builds its classpath. For more information, see https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/17766.

There are a few ways this can be dealt with.

- To simply get the app running, run the compiled jar with
[source]
---
java -jar .\target\ms-tutorial-getting-started.jar
---

- To enable debugging, instead run the compiled jar with
[source]
----
java -jar -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=8004 .\target\ms-tutorial-getting-started.jar
----

- If running the app through IntelliJ, there are `Run/Debug Configuration` options to shorten the command line. In the run configuration, set "Shorten Command Line" to either `JAR Manifest` or `manifest file`. Visit the JetBrains website for more information, https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2020.1/run-debug-configuration-spring-boot.html

- A work-around to allow running with `mvn spring-boot:run` is to soft link your .m2 directory to the root of the drive. This will shorten the overall classpath by reducing absolute filepaths in your dependencies.
